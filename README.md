# Overview
The gaml.extension.unitu GAMA plugin  provides a number of tools and GAML extensions (built-in species and new experiment type) to transform a GAMA model into a Unity 3D universe.
It works with the [simple UNITY template](https://github.com/project-SIMPLE/simple.template.unity) and the [simple server middleware](https://github.com/project-SIMPLE/GamaServerMiddleware). 


# Installation

## From GAMA
To use the plugin from a release version of GAMA (version 1.9.3), it can be installed directly from the plugin installer.
Specifically, select "Support/Install new plugins..." from the menu, then "Work with", copy the address (https://project-simple.github.io/gaml.extension.unity/)[https://project-simple.github.io/gaml.extension.unity/] and select the plugin afterwards.

## Developer mode 
If you have a developer version of GAMA (branch 1.9.3), you can clone the project directly to add the plugin to GAMA.
